# Twitch-Stream-Search-Tool
Twitch stream search app using Vanilla JavaScript to fetch and show streams from Twitch API

## Motivation
Technical Challenge

## Specifications

- Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online).
- Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock.
- Build out the list as shown in the mock.
- All UI elements are mandatory and self explanatory.
- Each list entry should link to the corresponding Twitch stream.
- Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements.
